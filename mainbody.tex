\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a practical cache side channel attack on ECDSA implementations which use
 the windowed Non-Adjacent-Form (wNAF) representation to compute the scalar multiplication over elliptic curves.
Compared with existing works,
    our method exploits more information from the cache side channels,
      which is then efficiently used to construct lattice attacks in the ECDSA private key recovery.
First,
  different from previous works only monitoring the double and add functions of the scalar multiplication in the cache side channel attacks,
   we additionally monitor the invert function which is related to the sign of the wNAF digits,
    and obtain a Double-Add-Invert chain through the cache side channel.
   %and
    %obtain the sign information of the wNAF representation of an ephemeral key through it.
 %we monitor the invert function in the OpenSSL implementation of the scalar multiplication,
  %  in addition to the functions of double and add which are the only ones exploited in the literature.
%By monitoring the invert function,
    %we obtain the signs of the wNAF representation of an ephemeral key.
% Through this improvement, we obtain the extra information about the sign of the wNAF representations the ephemeral key.
Then, we develop effective methods extracting
    $154.2$ bits information of the ephemeral key per signature
    for 256-bit ECDSA from this chain,
    much more than the best known result which extracts $105.8$ bits per signature.
Finally, to efficiently use the extracted information,
    we convert the problem of recovering the private key to the Hidden Number Problem (HNP) and the Extended Hidden Number Problem (EHNP) respectively,
 which are solved by lattice reduction algorithms.
We implemented  the attack on ECDSA with the secp256k1 curve in OpenSSL 1.1.0h.
The experimental results show that only $2$ signatures are enough to recover the private key.  % is successfully recovered from only $2$ signatures,
 %   if the side channel is built without any error. %, which is also required in other works and can be achieved with existing cache side channel attacks.
To the best of our knowledge, this work
            exploits the signs of the wNAF representation,                  % all signs不需要强调
                along with the Double-Add chain   in the side channel attacks against ECDSA,
        to recover the private key with \emph{the least number of signatures}.
