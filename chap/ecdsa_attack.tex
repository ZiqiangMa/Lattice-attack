\section{Improving Cache Side Channel Attack on wNAF Representation}
\label{sec:attack}
This section proposes how to get more information about the ephemeral key with the wNAF representation through the cache side channel.
First, we analyse the invert function in the scalar multiplication with wNAF representation in the ECDSA implementation
and show how to use the Double-Add-Invert chain from the cache side channel to extract the information about the ephemeral key.
 Then we implemented the Flush+Flush attack to the secp256k1 curve in OpenSSL 1.1.0h to obtain
the cache side channel information.
The details of the implementation and the attack result are provided.


%After that, we make use of the obtained information to recover the consecutive bits at the position of every non-zero digits of $k$.
%Finally, we construct an HNP instance by the consecutive bits and transform it to the problem of solving the SVP/CVP in some lattice with the lattice reduction algorithms.
%Note that the steps in existing works do not work for the signs of the non-zero digits.
%So we have to first obtain consecutive bits of the ephemeral key by converting the wNAF representation to the binary representation.
%Then, we use these consecutive bits to construct the HNP instance.

\subsection{Attacking wNAF through the Cache Side Channels}
\label{data_get}
As described in Section~\ref{intro_smulinssl}, the implementation of scalar multiplication in OpenSSL uses the invert function to
  compute the inverse element of a point.
With this function, the storage of precomputed points is saved by half, as only $\{G, 3G, ..., (2^{w} - 1)G\}$ are needed to be stored.
As shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:smopenssl},
the $kG$ computation iterates $k$ from the most significant digit to the least significant digit.
In each digit, it performs a double function.
If the digit is not zero and the sign of the digit is opposite to the prior one, the invert function is called.
Finally,  the addition function is called to add the internal value of $kG$ with a precomputed point indexed by  the absolute value of the digit. % and performs an addition operation.

Originally, the vulnerability comes from the double and add function.
The double function is called at every digit, and this reveals the digit sequence.
The add function is called just when the digit is non-zero,
  which makes it possible to distinguish whether the digit is zero or not.
  That reveals the position of all non-zero digits.
However,
 the invert function is also vulnerable, because it is called conditionally.
Only when the sign of the non-zero digit is opposite to the previous one, the invert function will be performed.
Because the first non-zero digit is positive,
   then the signs of all the non-zero digit are deduced based on the execution of the invert function.


We use a spy process to monitor  the double, add and invert functions during computing the scalar multiplication.
The time is divided into slots, and in each slot,
  the spy determines whether the three functions are performed or not by monitoring the cache hits/misses.
 Then we obtain a Double-Add-Invert chain.
According to the Double and Add in this chain, we determine whether each digit of $k$ is zero or not,
    as done in previous works.
Then, based on the Invert in this chain, we infer the sign of each non-zero digit.


In the OpenSSL versions between 0.9.7 and 1.1.0h,
 the functions of double, add and invert are implemented as \verb+EC_POINT_dbl()+, \verb+EC_POINT_add()+ and \verb+EC_POINT_invert()+.
 Existing attacks only monitor the functions \verb+EC_POINT_dbl()+ and \verb+EC_POINT_add()+.
In our attack, we improve the cache side channel attacks by adding an extra monitor to the \verb+EC_POINT_invert()+ function.
 In each time slot,
  the spy determines whether three functions are performed or not.
Then we get a new Double-Add-Invert chain through the cache side channel attack.

When we use the Double-Add-Invert chain to extract the digits of $k$,
the Double represents the double function is called,
and the Add represents  both double and add are called.
The Invert represents the invert function is called.
Therefore,
 the appearance of Double  means that $k_i$ is zero
and the Add  means that $k_i$ is not zero.
We use the Invert to determine the sign of $k_i$.
The sign of $k_i$ is related to the previous non-zero digit.
First, the Invert comes out together with Add.
If the Invert appears, it represents that the sign of $k_i$ is opposite to the previous non-zero digit.
 While, if the Invert does not appear when Add comes out, it represents that
the sign of this digit is the same as the previous non-zero one.
In the wNAF representation of $k$, the most significant digit is always positive.
 Thus, we can determine the sign of all non-zero digits.
In this way, we obtain both the positions and signs of all non-zero digits.


% In our work, we implement the Flush+Flush attack to obtain the ''double-add-invert'' chain because it has a better precision.

\subsection{The Implementation of Flush+Flush Attack}
\label{ffattack}
We launched the cache side channel attack to obtain the partial information of the ECDSA on an Acer Veriton T830 running Ubuntu 16.04.
The machine features an Intel Core i7-6700 processor with four execution cores and an $8$ MB LLC.
The attacking target is the ECDSA implemented in OpenSSL 1.1.0h, which uses wNAF representation in the scalar multiplication.
Both the Flush+Reload and Flush+Flush attacks can be used, but we choose
the Flush+Flush to attack the 256-bit curve secp256k1 for the experiments due to the accuracy as described in Section~\ref{intro_cacheattack}.

%平台

\noindent\textbf{Get the virtual address. }
We need to know the virtual addresses of the three monitored functions.
First, we get the offsets of the three functions in the code of the dynamic library.
Then, we use the \verb+mmap()+ function to load each page locating the monitored function codes into the virtual address space of the spy process.
The \verb+mmap()+ function will return the initial address of the page so that we can get the virtual address of the monitored function based on the offset and the address of this page.
An alternative way is to use the \verb+dl_iterate_phdr()+ function to get the initial address of the dynamic library when it is loaded. % into the address space.

To determine the offsets of the memory lines in the  dynamic library,  we build OpenSSL with debugging symbols.
 These symbols are not loaded at run time and do not affect the performance of the code.
Typically the debugging symbols are not available for attackers,
 however, they could use reverse engineering [16] to determine the offsets.



%获取虚拟地址

%首先获取所需监控函数代码在动态库中的偏移量
%接着获取函数代码虚拟地址，有两种方法
%使用mmap()函数，将所监控函数代码所在页加载入地址空间中，获取到函数代码的虚拟地址
%或编译时链接动态库，运行时使用dl_iterate_phdr()函数，获取到动态库加载入地址空间的起始地址，根据偏移量，获得函数代码的虚拟地址
%
%
%
%Victim：通过调用OpenSSL的crypto.so库来进行ECDSA签名运算。
%Attacker：使用和victim相同的crypto库，对victim使用的点加和倍点函数以及EC_POINT_invert()代码所在的cache行进行监控。



\noindent\textbf{Threshold.}
We monitor the execution time of the \verb+clflush+ instruction to flush the monitored functions.
If the time is larger than the threshold, meaning the memory line is accessed by the victim.
Otherwise, the memory line is not accessed.
The thresholds are calculated for every monitored function.
For each address of the monitored functions, we record the time of flushing the cache 1000 times, and take the time larger than 99 percent samples plus 6 cycles as the threshold for this address.
The thresholds are recalculated every time before the attack is mounted.


%阈值
%对每个需要监控的地址都计算各自的阈值
%每次监测都重新计算阈值
%对每个地址，监控1000次flush花费的时间，取99%以上样本所花的最大时间加上6作为该地址的阈值


\noindent\textbf{Trigger the monitoring.}
We monitor the flushing time of the address of the three functions.
When the time of any one is larger than the corresponding threshold,
 we start to record the flushing times.
The record stops when the number of the consecutive flushing time of all the monitored addresses less than the threshold  is larger than 300.
If the number of record is less than 1000, we re-record the execution time.
Then we have a valid record.
 Due to the  disturbance of noise,
  the valid record does not necessarily contain the activities in the scalar multiplication.
So we continuously obtain 10 valid records.
%触发
%1) 某一个监控地址的flush时间大于阈值以后，开始记录；
%2）所有地址连续小于阈值的数量大于200后，停止记录；
%3）如果记录数据量小于1000，重新开始记录；
%4）连续记录10次。


\noindent\textbf{Time slot.}
For the attack, the spy process divides time into time slots of approximately $2500$ cycles.
In each slot, the spy flushes the memory lines in the add, double and invert functions (\verb+EC_POINT_dbl()+,  \verb+EC_POINT_add()+ and \verb+EC_POINT_invert()+) out of the caches.
%Also, the length of the time slot is chosen to ensure that the three functions only execute once.
%This allows the spy to correctly distinguish consecutive doubles.

%\noindent\textbf{Determine the initial point.}
%In order to precisely recover the sign of the ephemeral key, we need to determine which sample represents the start of the scalar multiplication.
%We can determine the
%start of the scalar multiplication
%by combining the double-add chain and the profiles of the double and add functions with wNAF representation.
%Also, we can determine the start position by monitoring the code of the copy function in OpenSSL.
% We note that when the computation of scalar multiplication starts, OpenSSL performs the copy function instead of the add function.
% Thus we can monitor the copy function, and when the copy function is called in the time slot and the add function is called in the next slot, it means that the scalar multiplication starts.

%起始判断
%对标量乘法代码分析，在对k的最高位处理时，并不是使用的点加，而是copy，因此，可以对copy函数进行监控，当一个时间槽内进行了倍点和copy操作，可以认定标量乘法的开始。
%如果不监控copy，也可以根据点加倍点的发生，去排除错误的触发；也可以根据NAF编码时点加倍点的特征来判断起始。

\noindent\textbf{Experimental results.}
Fig.~\ref{fig1} shows a fragment of the output of the spy when OpenSSL performs ECDSA with the secp256k1 curve.
In this figure, $\square$, $\lozenge$ and $\vartriangle$ represent ``double'', ``add'' and ``invert'' respectively.
From this fragment, three operations are clearly distinguished,
 so we can easily obtain the Double-Add-Invert chain.



%%10次实验
%We totally run 10 experiments, i.e. monitoring the ECDSA signature 10 times.
%The accurate rate is defined as the value of the actual number of bits obtained divided by the ideal number of bits available.
%Thus, from these experiments the average accurate rate of the data obtained from the Flush+Flush attack is xx\%.

%This section proposes a new method to recover the private key of ECDSA.

%\subsection{Attacking wNAF through the Cache Side Channels}
%\label{data_get}
%First, recalling the implementation of scalar multiplication in OpenSSL, it uses the invert function to
%  compute the inverse element of a number.
%Applying this function, the space of precomputed points is saved by half, only need to store $\{G, 3G, ..., (2^{w} - 1)G\}$.

%
%
%We use a spy process to monitor one memory line of the code of the double, add and invert functions during the scalar multiplication.
%The time is divided into slots, and in each slot,
%  the spy determines whether the three functions are performed or not by monitoring the cache hits/misses.

%According to the ``double'' and ``add'' in this chain, we determine whether each digit of $k$ is zero or not,
%    as done in previous works.
%Also, based on the ``invert'' in this chain, we infer the sign of each non-zero digit.
%
%
%In the OpenSSL library (especially the latest OpenSSL 1.1.1b),
% the functions of double, add and invert are implemented as \verb+EC_POINT_dbl()+, \verb+EC_POINT_add()+ and \verb+EC_POINT_invert()+.

%In our attack, we improve the original cache side channel attack by adding a new monitor to the \verb+EC_POINT_invert()+ function.

%\subsection{Recovering Consecutive Bits}
%\label{data_proc1}
%In this section, we introduce how to recover the consecutive bits at the position of every non-zero bits for the ephemeral key $k$, exploiting the information obtained from the side channel.
%
%First, we denote the wNAF representation of $k$ as $k = \sum{k_{i}2^{i}}$,
% and the binary representation as $k = \sum{b_{i}2^{i}}$.
%From the Algorithm \ref{alg:wnaf} we know that the position of $k_i$ in the wNAF representation is the same as $b_i$ in the binary representation.
% When we know the information about whether $k_i$ is zero and the sign of the non-zero $k_i$, we can simply determine some bits of $k$.
% For example, if we obtain the sign of the least non-zero $k_j$, we can infer that $b_j$ is one and $b_i$ is zero for $0\leq i<j$.
% But for arbitrary non-zero digits, it can not determine whether the bit is zero or one.
%
% Let $m$ and $m + n$ be the positions of two consecutive non-zero digits of the wNAF representation, and $w$ be the window size.
% That is, $k_m, k_{m+n} \neq 0$ and $k_{m+i} = 0$ for all $0 < i < n$.
% We analyse the transformation method between the binary and wNAF representation, getting the following result:
%
% \begin{align}
% &b_{m+n} = \left\{
% \begin{aligned}
% 	&0,\,\;\ \   k_m < 0 \\
% 	&1,\,\;\ \   k_m > 0
% \end{aligned}
% \right.  , \\
% &b_{m+i} = \left\{
% \begin{aligned}
% 	&0,\,\;\ \   k_m > 0 \\
% 	&1,\,\;\ \   k_m < 0
% \end{aligned}
% \right.
% ,\ \ \ \ \  w \leq i \leq n-1
% \end{align}
%%这里的公式有漏洞，需要加上最低位即m最小时的bm
%
%And if $m$ is the position of the least non-zero digit of $k$,
% \begin{align}
% &b_{i} = \left\{
% \begin{aligned}
% 	&1,\,\;\ \   i = m \\
% 	&0,\,\;\ \   0 \leq i < m
% \end{aligned}
% \right.  .
% \end{align}
%
%In this way, at the position of every non-zero digit we can obtain $n - w + 1$ consecutive bits of $k$
% except at the  position of the least non-zero digit being $m+1$.
%For the wNAF representation, every non-zero digit (except the least) is followed by at least $w$ zero values.
% The average number of non-zero digits of $k$ is $(\lfloor\log_{2}{q}\rfloor +1) /(w+2)$.
% The average distance between consecutive non-zero digits is $w+2$, i.e. on average $n = w + 2$.
% This means we can obtain $3$ consecutive bits on average at the every non-zero digit (except the least).
%Based on \cite{Benger2014} on average we can get $2$ least significant bits of the ephemeral key.
%Thus, on average we can obtain $3(\lfloor\log_{2}{q}\rfloor+1) /(w+2) - 1$ bits of the ephemeral key $k$ in total.
%Meanwhile, because the minimal value of $n$ is $w + 1$, the minimal length of the consecutive bits is $2$.
%This illustrates that all the sequences of consecutive bits obtained (except the least) are no less than $2$ bits.
%
%For the secp256k1 curve implemented in OpenSSL, $\lfloor\log_{2}{q}\rfloor  + 1= 256$, $w = 3$.
% Also, as introduced previous, the scalar multiplication uses $k+q$ instead of $k$ in most cases,
%  so the total number of bits per signature we obtain is $3(\lfloor\log_{2}{q}\rfloor +2)/(w+2)-1 = 153.2$.
%In theory, two signatures would be enough to recover the 256-bit private key as $2\times 153.2 = 306.4 > 256$.
%
%%这里再加一小段，理论上[文献x]说，只要知道连续的2bit信息，就能够用来构造格攻击恢复密钥。
%%因此，对侧信道得到的数据使用我们的方法恢复出来的连续比特位，全部都可以被用到后续的攻击中

%\subsection{Constructing the Lattice Attack}
%\label{data_proc2}
%In this section, we transform the problem of recovering the private key to the HNP instance, and further convert to the CVP/SVP instance in a lattice.
%Our method is based on the analysis from \cite{Nguyen2002}.
%But we make some improvements to it.
%First, the length of the consecutive bits used to construct the lattice is variable while the prior work fixes the length, which may lose some information.
%Second,  in our method the position of consecutive bits is arbitrary in the ephemeral key and does not need to be fixed, while the prior work needs all the consecutive bits at the same position.
%Finally, from one signature we obtain multiple sequences of consecutive bits, and all of them can be used for constructing the lattice as long as the length of the sequence is satisfied, while the prior work only generates one sequence of consecutive bits for one signature.
%
%To construct an HNP instance using arbitrary consecutive bits, we need to use the following theorem\cite{Nguyen2002}:
%\begin{theorem}
% \label{theorem1}
%There exists a polynomial-time algorithm which, given $A$ and $B$ in $[1, q]$, finds $\lambda \in Z^{*}_{q}$ such that
%$$
%|\lambda |_q < B  \ \  \text{and} \ \  |\lambda A|_q \leq q/B .
%$$
%\end{theorem}
%The value of $\lambda$ can be computed exploiting the continued fractions.
%
%Recall the ECDSA signature, $s = k^{-1} (h(m) + r\cdot\alpha) \bmod q$.
%We rewrite it as
%\begin{equation}
%\label{sig}
%\alpha rs^{-1} = k - s^{-1}h(m)  \ \  \text{mod} \ \ q.
%\end{equation}
%Then assume that we have the $l$ consecutive bits of $k$ with the value of $a$, starting at some known position $j$.
% So $k$ is represented as $k = 2^{j}a + 2^{l+j}b +c$ for $0 \leq a \leq 2^l -1$, $0\leq b \leq q/2^{l+j}$ and $0 \leq c < 2^j$.
% We apply the theorem with $A = 2^{j+l}$ and $B = q2^{-j-l/2}$, to obtain $\lambda$ such that
%$$
%|\lambda |_q < q2^{-j-l/2}  \ \  \text{and} \ \  |\lambda 2^{j+l}|_q \leq q/2^{j+l/2} .
%$$
%
%Plugging the value of $k$ and multiplying by $\lambda$, Equation \ref{sig} is transformed to
%$$
%\alpha r\lambda s^{-1} = (2^{j}a - s^{-1}h(m))\lambda +(c\lambda + 2^{l+j}b\lambda)  \ \  \bmod \ \ q.
%$$
%
% Let
% \begin{equation}
% \label{tu}
% \left\{
% \begin{aligned}
% 	&t = \lfloor r\lambda s^{-1} \rfloor_q    \\
% 	&u = \lfloor (2^{j}a - s^{-1}h(m))\lambda \rfloor_q
% \end{aligned}
% \right. ,
% \end{equation}
% where $\lfloor \cdot\rfloor_q$ denotes the reduction modulo $q$ into range $[0, ..., q)$.
%
%We then have that
% \begin{equation}
%\label{lattice}
%    |\alpha t - u|_q < q/2^{(l/2-1)}.
%\end{equation}
%This way, we transform to an HNP instance.
%
%In practice, OpenSSL uses $k+q$ as the ephemeral key. So the Equation \ref{tu} remains the same, but the Inequality~\ref{lattice} turns into
% \begin{equation}
%\label{lattice2}
%    |\alpha t - u|_q < q/2^{(l/2-\log_{2}{3})}.
%\end{equation}
%
%Note that, the Equation \ref{lattice2} represents that the $l/2-\log_{2}{3} -1$ most significant bits of $\lfloor\alpha t\rfloor_q$ is $u$, based on the definition of the HNP.
%So it should satisfy that $l/2-\log_{2}{3} -1 \geq 1$, i.e. $l > 7$.
%That means the length of the consecutive bits used to  construct the HNP instance should be larger than $7$,
%although we could use all the sequences of the consecutive bits of the ephemeral key in theory.
%
%Next we turn the HNP instance into the lattice problem.
%We use $d$ triples $(t_i, u_i, l_i)$ to construct a $d+1$ dimensional lattice $L(B)$ spanned by the rows of the following matrix:
%$$B =
%\left(
%  \begin{array}{ccccc}
%    2^{l_1+1}q & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
%    0 & 2^{l_2+1}q & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
%    \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & 0 & \vdots \\
%    0 & \cdots & 0 & 2^{l_d+1}q & 0 \\
%    2^{l_1+1}t_1 & \cdots & \cdots & 2^{l_d+1}t_d & 1 \\
%  \end{array}
%\right).
%$$
%Considering the vector $\textbf{x} = (2^{l_1+1}\alpha t_1 \bmod q, ..., 2^{l_d+1}\alpha t_d \bmod q, \alpha)$,
% it can be obtained by multiplying the last row vector of $B$ by $\alpha$ and then subtracting appropriate multiples of the first $d$ row vectors.
%Thus the vector $\textbf{x}$ belongs to $L(B)$.
%Let the vector $\textbf{u} = (2^{l_1+1}u_1, ..., 2^{l_d+1}u_d, 0)$,
% so the distance between $\textbf{x}$ and $\textbf{u}$ is $\|\textbf{x} - \textbf{u}\| \leq q\sqrt{d+1}$.
%While the lattice determinant of $L(B)$ is $2^{d + \sum{l_i}}q^d$,
% thus the vector $\textbf{x}$ is very close to the vector $\textbf{u}$.
%By solving the CVP problem with the input $B$ and $\textbf{u}$, the vector $\textbf{x}$ is revealed,
% hence the private key $\alpha$ is recovered as it is the last element of the vector $\textbf{x}$.
%
%To solve the CVP problem in polynomial time,
%we transform it to an SVP instance.
% We use $d$ triples $(t_i, u_i, l_i)$ to construct a $d+2$ dimensional lattice $L(B')$ spanned by the rows of the matrix
%$$B' =
%\left(
%  \begin{array}{cc}
%     B\ \  &\  0\ \  \\
%    \textbf{u}\ \ &\ q \ \  \\
%  \end{array}
%\right).

%Similarly, the vector $\textbf{x}' = (2^{l_1+1}(\alpha t_1 - u_1) \bmod q, ..., 2^{l_d+1}(\alpha t_d - u_d) \bmod q, \alpha, -q)$ belongs to the lattice $L(B')$.
% Its norm satisfies that $\|\textbf{x}'\| \leq q\sqrt{d+2}$,
%  while the lattice determinant of $L(B')$ is $2^{d + \sum{l_i}}q^{d+1}$.
%   This indicates that the vector $\textbf{x}'$ is a very short vector.
%Note that this lattice also contains another vector $(-t_1, ..., -t_d, q, 0)\cdot B = (0, ..., 0, q, 0)$,
% which is most likely the shortest vector of the lattice.
%Therefore we expect the second vector in a reduced basis of the lattice is equal to $\textbf{x}'$ with a ``good'' chance for a suitably lattice reduction algorithm.
%Then we acquire the secret key $\alpha$.
