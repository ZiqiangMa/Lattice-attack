%\subsection{Scalar Multiplication in Other Cryptographic Libraries}
%Besides the OpenSSL library, there are many cryptographic libraries that implement the scalar multiplication.
%But not all of them use the wNAF representation.
%We introduce some implementations of the scalar multiplication in some popular cryptographic libraries.
%
%The mbed TLS \cite{polarssl} is an open source SSL library licensed by ARM Limited.
%It does not use the wNAF algorithm to represent the scalar.
%It uses a comb method that generates a sequence of bit-strings to represent the scalar $k$ so that every bit-string represents an odd number based on modifying the method in \cite{Hedabou2004ACM}.
%When computing the scalar multiplication, it traverses the sequence and directly indexes the value in the precomputed points to perform the addition.
%It does not use the invert function,
%and this representation is hard to attack by the cache side channels because all the elements of the sequence are not zero.
%
%Libgcrypt \cite{libgcrypt} is a cryptography library developed as a separated module of GnuPG.
%It directly uses the binary representation of the scalar instead of the wNAF representation to compute the scalar multiplication in the prime field.
%%Although it does not exploit the wNAF algorithm, it is vulnerable to the cache side channel attacks.
%To resist the side channel attacks, it performs an extra addition operation when the binary bit of the scalar is zero so that in every bit the double and addition are both performed.
%Therefore, lattice attacks to this library are invalid.

%Crypto++ Library \cite{cryptopp} is a free C++ class library of cryptographic algorithms and schemes.

%\subsection{The Method of Constructing Lattice Attacks}
%In our work, we construct an HNP instance using partial information about the $k$ obtained from the cache side channel attack.
% From the Inequation~\ref{lattice2}, the length of the most significant bits of $\lfloor\alpha t_i\rfloor$ is $l/2-\log_{2}{3} -1$.
%When constructing the lattice, it should contain the information about the most significant bits of $\lfloor\alpha t_i\rfloor$.
%Thus it requests $l/2-\log_{2}{3} -1 \geq 1$, so $l$ representing the minimal length of the consecutive bits needs to be larger than $7$.
%In practice, only when $l > 8$, we successfully recover the ECDSA private key in our experiments.
%However, the average length of the consecutive bits is $3$, which is much smaller than needed.
%This makes it impossible to use all the bits obtained through the cache side channel attack  to construct the lattice attack.
%Although in theory we only need $2$ signatures to recover the 256-bit private key,
% in practice we need at least $60$ signatures to get enough information satisfied the restriction on $l$ to construct the lattice attack.
%Therefore due to the restriction on $l$, we can not make full use of the information obtained from the cache side channel although we obtained $153.2$ bits information per signature on average.
%
%However, based on the work in~\cite{Nguyen2002} and \cite{Liu2013},
% in theory when the length of the consecutive bits is $2$, this sequence of  the consecutive bits can be used to construct the lattice attack.
%In our work, all the sequences of consecutive bits (except the least) obtained from the cache side channel satisfy $l \geq 2$,
% and the length the consecutive least significant bits is larger than $1$.
% That means at least $152.2$ bits information we obtained is valid and exploitable, only $1$ bit information may be discarded.
%Therefore, if we find an efficient way to construct the lattice attack, making full use of all the information of the consecutive bits,
%   the number of signatures required to recover the private key can be greatly reduced, even the best case only $2$ signatures is enough for a 256-bit private key.
%In theory, this result is better than the prior work in \cite{Fan2016} which theoretically needs 3 signatures for a 256-bit private key.
%This is what we are going to do next, finding a suitable and powerful method to construct the lattice attack.

%我们的工作中，我们使用了XX方法
%我们的方法有什么限制：l需要很大
%造成什么结果：无法利用所有的有效数据，需要使用很多的签名
%所以尽管我们获取到了许多数据，但并不能够充分利用。

%而理论上讲，我们获取到的数据满足l>=3的条件，
%根据参考文献，只要l=2就可以被用来进行格攻击
%因此，我们获取到的数据全部都是有效数据，可以被利用的，并不存在需要抛弃的数据
%只需要找到合适的方法来构造格攻击，就可以充分利用数据，从而大大降低所需要的签名数量，
%理论上，我们只需要两个签名，结果会好于fan。
%这也是我们接下来要去做的工作，找到一个合适的构造格的方法。

\subsection{The Imperfect Data from the Cache Side Channel}
\label{subsec:unperfect}
%之前的格攻击分析都是基于完美的侧信道数据进行的。
%在实际中，侧信道数据不会是完美的。
%对于不完美的侧信道，van进行了分析，对于Flush+reload获得的数据，得到的结论是：
%因此，使用我们的格攻击，使用fr攻击获得数据，一共需要。。个签名。
%
%而我们在实验时选择了使用ff攻击，它和fr攻击类似，因此也可以用同样的方法来对其进行分析。

Our lattice attack analysis is based on the perfect Double-Add-Invert chain, which means no errors exist in the chain.
But, achieving the perfect chain is almost impossible from the practical cache side channels.
Van de Pol et al.~\cite{Van2015} analysed the actual data obtained from the Flush+Reload attack.
Their statistical results show that $57.7\%$ of the obtained Double-Add chains are perfect.
We also can monitor the functions using the Flush+Reload attack,
 so the probability of the perfect Double-Add-Invert chain is also $57.7\%$, the same as Van de Pol's.
Thus, the actual number of signatures needed to recover the 256-bit ECDSA private key is $4$.

While in our experiments, we use the Flush+Flush attack to obtain the Double-Add-Invert chain.
Compared with Flush+Reload, the Flush+Flush is more easily to have errors, because the distributions of the execution time of the \verb+clflush+ instruction on cached and non-cached memory have some overlapping and the
difference in timing of this instruction is less.
So the probability to obtain the perfect chain is less than $57.7\%$.
We can re-measure the probability of obtaining the perfect chain using the same method with Van de Pol
 and achieve the actual number of needed signatures.


\subsection{The Precision of the Cache Side Channel Attacks}

Compared with Flush+Reload, the Flush+Flush can run in a higher frequency,
 because the execution time of the \verb+clflush+ instruction is less than the access time of the reloading operation and it can merge the two Flush stages into one to save the execution time.
So it obtains the Double-Add-Invert chain with less missing slots.
But the distributions of the execution time of the \verb+clflush+ instruction on cached and non-cached memory have
 some overlapping and the difference in timing of this instruction is less,
  so that it may make some wrong judgements on the Double-Add-Invert chain.
Therefore, for the obtained Double-Add-Invert chain,
 Flush+Flush and Flush+Reload produce different errors: Flush+Reload is more likely to produce the missing time slots, while Flush+Flush is more likely to produce the wrong observations.

We can choose the suitable time slot and monitoring addresses to reduce the wrong observations and
 using some optimisations to improve the Double-Add-Invert chain.
 In this way, the chain from Flush+Flush can be more accurate.
So in our paper, we use the Flush+Flush attack to show the availability of monitoring the invert function and obtain the Double-Add-Invert chain.

%For the Flush+Flush, we can eliminate the through careful configuration.
