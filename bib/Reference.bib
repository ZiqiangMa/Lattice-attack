abstract="The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is the elliptic curve analogue of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). It was accepted in 1999 as an ANSI standard and in 2000 as IEEE and NIST standards. It was also accepted in 1998 as an ISO standard and is under consideration for inclusion in some other ISO standards. Unlike the ordinary discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem, no subexponential-time algorithm is known for the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. For this reason, the strength-per-key-bit is substantially greater in an algorithm that uses elliptic curves. This paper describes the ANSI X9.62 ECDSA, and discusses related security, implementation, and interoperability issues.",

abstract="At Crypto `86, Boneh and Venkatesan introduced the so-called hidden number problem: in a prime field â„¤ q, recover a number $\alpha$ such that for many known random t, the most significant bits of t$\alpha$ are known. They showed that Babai's LLL-based polynomial-time nearest plane algorithm for approximating the lattice closest vector problem solves the problem with probability at least {\$}{\$}{\backslash}frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}{\$}, provided that the number of bits known (for each t$\alpha$) is greater than {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sqrt {\{}{\backslash}log q{\}}  + {\backslash}log {\backslash}log q{\$}{\$}. That result is often cited as the only positive application known in cryptology of the LLL algorithm, because it enables to prove the hardness of the most significant bits of secret keys in Diffie-Hellman and related schemes. The purpose of this short and elementary note is to highlight the fact that the result also has a dark side. Indeed, we remark that the hidden number problem is an idealized version of the problem which HowgraveGraham and Smart recently tried to solve heuristically in their (lattice-based) attacks on DSA and related signature schemes: given a few bits of the random nonces k used in sufficiently many DSA signatures, recover the secret key. This suggests to determine what can be achieved in practice, rather than in theory. Since lattice reduction algorithms are known to behave much more nicely than their proved worst-case bounds, we give the number of bits that enables the Boneh-Venkatesan technique to succeed, provided an oracle for the lattice closest vector problem in the Euclidean norm or the infinity norm. An analogous assumption is used in the well-known lattice-based attacks against low-density subset sums. Interestingly, our experiments support our theoretical bounds and improve the experimental bounds of Howgrave-Graham and Smart.",

abstract="For over two decades, timing attacks have been an active area of research within applied cryptography. These attacks exploit cryptosystem or protocol implementations that do not run in constant time. When implementing an elliptic curve cryptosystem with a goal to provide side-channel resistance, the scalar multiplication routine is a critical component. In such instances, one attractive method often suggested in the literature is Montgomery's ladder that performs a fixed sequence of curve and field operations. This paper describes a timing attack vulnerability in OpenSSL's ladder implementation for curves over binary fields. We use this vulnerability to steal the private key of a TLS server where the server authenticates with ECDSA signatures. Using the timing of the exchanged messages, the messages themselves, and the signatures, we mount a lattice attack that recovers the private key. Finally, we describe and implement an effective countermeasure.",

We first develop a new way of extracting information from the side-channel results of the ECDSA signatures. Just given a small fraction of the information about a side-channel result denoted as double-and-add chain, we take advantage of the length of the chain together with positions of two non-zero digits to recover information about the ephemeral key. Combining the information of both the most significant digits and the least significant bits, we are able to gain more information about the ephemeral key. The problem of recovering ECDSA secret key is then translated to the hidden number problem which can be solved by lattice reduction algorithms. Our attack is mounted to the secp256k1 curve, and the result shows that 85 signatures would be enough to recover the secret key, which is better than the result that previous attack gained only utilizing the information extracted from the least significant bits, using about 200 signatures to recover the secret key.",

abstract="Elliptic curve cryptography is today the prevailing approach to get efficient public-key cryptosystems and digital signatures. Most of elliptic curve signature schemes use a nonce in the computation of each signature and the knowledge of this nonce is sufficient to fully recover the secret key of the scheme. Even a few bits of the nonce over several signatures allow a complete break of the scheme by lattice-based attacks. Several works have investigated how to efficiently apply such attacks when partial information on the nonce can be recovered through side-channel attacks. However, these attacks usually target unprotected implementation and/or make ideal assumptions on the recovered information, and it is not clear how they would perform in a scenario where common countermeasures are included and where only noisy information leaks via side channels. In this paper, we close this gap by applying such attack techniques against elliptic-curve signature implementations based on a blinded scalar multiplication. Specifically, we extend the famous Howgrave-Graham and Smart lattice attack when the nonces are blinded by the addition of a random multiple of the elliptic-curve group order or by a random Euclidean splitting. We then assume that noisy information on the blinded nonce can be obtained through a template attack targeting the underlying scalar multiplication and we show how to characterize the obtained likelihood scores under a realistic leakage assumption. To deal with this scenario, we introduce a filtering method which given a set of signatures and associated likelihood scores maximizes the success probability of the lattice attack. Our approach is backed up with attack simulation results for several signal-to-noise ratio of the exploited leakage.",

In this paper, we present two new lattice-based differential fault attacks (DFA) against the famous ECC signature algorithm standard-ECDSA with wNAF algorithm of scalar multiplication. Compared with the fault attack proposed in Crypto'2000, our first attack adopts a different way to deduce parts of the nonce k. The former recovered parts of k mainly by guessing technique, while our attack combines the guessing technique and solving equation with one unknown. So our attack is applicable for the weaker attack scenes allowing more random faulty bits. In our second proposed attack, instead of injecting faults during calculating kG, we focus on injecting faults during calculating wNAF transformation of k before calculating kG. If the targets during wNAF transformation of k are skipped by fault injection, we can build some DFA models to retrieve parts of k. In both of the two attacks, the attacker can mount lattice attack to recover the private key in ECDSA with the derived parts of k. Finally, we verify the feasibility of our proposed attacks by experiments.",

An important question is how fast this exponentiation can be done, which often determines whether a given system is practical. The best method for exponentiation depends strongly on the group being used, the hardware the system is implemented on, and whether one element is being raised repeatedly to different powers, different elements are raised to a fixed power, or both powers and group elements vary. This problem has received much attention, but the results are scattered through the literature. In this paper we survey the known methods for fast exponentiation, examining their relative strengths and weaknesses."

By increasing the average length of zero runs in a signed binary representation of d, we can speed up the window method. Formulating the time complexity of the proposed method makes clear that the proposed method is faster than other methods. For example, for d with length 512 bits, the proposed method requires 602.6 multiplications on average.

In this paper, we present an efficient trace-driven cache attack on a widely used implementation of the AES cryptosystem. We also evaluate the cost of the proposed attack in detail under the assumption of a noiseless environment. We develop an accurate mathematical model that we use in the cost analysis of our attack. We use two different metrics, specifically, the expected number of necessary traces and the cost of the analysis phase, for the cost evaluation purposes. Each of these metrics represents the cost of a different phase of the attack.",

abstract="This paper describes several novel timing attacks against the common table-driven software implementation of the AES cipher. We define a general attack strategy using a simplified model of the cache to predict timing variation due to cache-collisions in the sequence of lookups performed by the encryption. The attacks presented should be applicable to most high-speed software AES implementations and computing platforms, we have implemented them against OpenSSL v.Â 0.9.8.(a) running on Pentium III, Pentium IV Xeon, and UltraSPARC III+ machines. The most powerful attack has been shown under optimal conditions to reliably recover a full 128-bit AES key with 213 timing samples, an improvement of almost four orders of magnitude over the best previously published attacks of this type [Ber05]. While the task of defending AES against all timing attacks is challenging, a small patch can significantly reduce the vulnerability to these specific attacks with no performance penalty.",

abstract="We describe several software side-channel attacks based on inter-process leakage through the state of the CPU's memory cache. This leakage reveals memory access patterns, which can be used for cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives that employ data-dependent table lookups. The attacks allow an unprivileged process to attack other processes running in parallel on the same processor, despite partitioning methods such as memory protection, sandboxing and virtualization. Some of our methods require only the ability to trigger services that perform encryption or MAC using the unknown key, such as encrypted disk partitions or secure network links. Moreover, we demonstrate an extremely strong type of attack, which requires knowledge of neither the specific plaintexts nor ciphertexts, and works by merely monitoring the effect of the cryptographic process on the cache. We discuss in detail several such attacks on AES, and experimentally demonstrate their applicability to real systems, such as OpenSSL and Linux's dm-crypt encrypted partitions (in the latter case, the full key can be recovered after just 800 writes to the partition, taking 65 milliseconds). Finally, we describe several countermeasures for mitigating such attacks.",

abstract="Recent results of Ajtai on the hardness of lattice problems have inspired several cryptographic protocols. At Crypto '97, Goldreich, Goldwasser and Halevi proposed a public-key cryptosystem based on the closest vector problem in a lattice, which is known to be NP-hard. We show that there is a major flaw in the design of the scheme which has two implications: any ciphertext leaks information on the plaintext, and the problem of decrypting ciphertexts can be reduced to a special closest vector problem which is much easier than the general problem. As an application, we solved four out of the five numerical challenges proposed on the Internet by the authors of the cryptosystem. At least two of those four challenges were conjectured to be intractable. We discuss ways to prevent the flaw, but conclude that, even modified, the scheme cannot provide sufficient security without being impractical.",

Lattice reduction algorithms have since proved invaluable in many areas of mathematics and computer science, especially in algorithmic number theory and cryptology. In this paper, we survey some applications of lattices to cryptology.

abstract="The best lattice reduction algorithm known in practice for high dimension is Schnorr-Euchner's BKZ: all security estimates of lattice cryptosystems are based on NTL's old implementation of BKZ. However, recent progress on lattice enumeration suggests that BKZ and its NTL implementation are no longer optimal, but the precise impact on security estimates was unclear. We assess this impact thanks to extensive experiments with BKZ 2.0, the first state-of-the-art implementation of BKZ incorporating recent improvements, such as Gama-Nguyen-Regev pruning. We propose an efficient simulation algorithm to model the behaviour of BKZ in high dimension with high blocksize â‰¥{\thinspace}50, which can predict approximately both the output quality and the running time, thereby revising lattice security estimates. For instance, our simulation suggests that the smallest NTRUSign parameter set, which was claimed to provide at least 93-bit security against key-recovery lattice attacks, actually offers at most 65-bit security.",

abstract="Analyzing the security of cryptosystems under attacks based on the malicious modification of memory registers is a research topic of high importance. This type of attack may affect the randomness of the secret parameters by forcing a limited number of bits to a certain value which can be unknown to the attacker. In this context, we revisit the attack on DSA presented by Faug{\`e}re, Goyet and Renault during the conference SAC 2012: we modify their method and provide a probabilistic approach in opposition to the heuristic proposed therein to measure the limits of the attack. More precisely, the main problem is formulated as a closest vector problem in a lattice, then we study the distribution of vectors with bounded norm in the lattices involved and apply the result to predict the attack behavior. The benefits of this approach are several: The probability of success of this attack can be lower bounded under some conjecture, which is validated by computational experiments. Also, it finds applications to the FLUSH+RELOAD side-channel attack, studied by van de Pol et al. At the end of the article, there is a summary of findings.",

abstract="In cloud computing, efficiencies are reaped by resource sharing such as co-location of computation and deduplication of data. This work exploits resource sharing in virtualization software to build a powerful cache-based attack on AES. We demonstrate the vulnerability by mounting Cross-VM Flush+Reload cache attacks in VMware VMs to recover the keys of an AES implementation of OpenSSL 1.0.1 running inside the victim VM. Furthermore, the attack works in a realistic setting where different VMs are located on separate cores. The modified flush+reload attack we present, takes only in the order of seconds to minutes to succeed in a cross-VM setting. Therefore long term co-location, as required by other fine grain attacks in the literature, are not needed. The results of this study show that there is a great security risk to OpenSSL AES implementation running on VMware cloud services when the deduplication is not disabled.",
